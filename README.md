# RecyCool

> Freecycling is a worldwide sharing movement that reduces waste, saves precious resources and eases the burden on landfills while enabling members to benefit from the strength of a caring community. RecyCool is a web app with the same mission. It builds on top of the Trash Nothing API - a popular online freecycle community.
